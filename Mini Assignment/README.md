Mini Aissgnment :-

1. Create an HTML page on which the left side should be home, contact, information, and guide.
2. Now after creating the left panel when I click on any of these components (home, contact...etc) content should be shown on the remaining screen example you created left panel when I click o contact contact information should be shown when I click on guide than some other information should be shown like that.
3. After doing this kindly upload it on google drive and shared a link.
